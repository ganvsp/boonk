      <em> What is Interior Designer? </em>
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>An interior designer is someone who works with a client to create aesthetic rooms and spaces.</li>
      <li>Clients range from homeowners to large corporations.</li>
      <li>The spaces and rooms interior designers create are equally varied, ranging from simple indoor and outdoor home environments to hotel lobbies and lavish mansions.</li>
      <li>No matter the size, every interior designer works to create spaces that are attractive yet functional. Spaces must also be safe while meeting the specific needs of the client.</li>
      <li><em>An interior designer is typically an independent contractor who must build a client base.</em></li>
      <li>In some instances, a designer will work for a larger firm. In either case, he or she must excel in order to build a positive reputation in the industry and secure future work.</li>
